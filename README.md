# semEval-task5-2025
In this task we used SemEval task 5 2025 dataset which was consisting of 50,000 documents. The task was predicting their description between 200,000 possible descriptions of gnd format. We trained a model using available LM's and contrastive learning. We were able to reach the acceptable Recall@5 of 25%.
Unfortunetly, due to our limited GPU resource we missed the deadline for this task and were unable to submit our results.
